## 1. Explain the difference between _Python 2_ and _Python 3_.

**Python 2.7** and **Python 3.x** are distinct versions of the Python programming language. They have some differences in syntax, features, and library support.

### Key Distinctions

**Python 2.7** is the last release in the 2.x series. It's still widely used but no longer actively developed. 

**Python 3** is the most recent version, with continuous updates and improvements. It's considered the present and future of the language.

### Major Changes

- **Print Statement**: Python 2 uses `print` as a statement, while Python 3 requires it to be used as a function: `print()`.
- **String Type**: In Python 2, there are two main string types: **byte** and **Unicode** strings. In Python 3, all strings are Unicode by default.
- **Division**: In Python 2, integer division results in an integer. Python 3 has a distinct operator `//` for this, while `/` gives a float.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling is more uniform in Python 3; exceptions should be enclosed in parentheses in `except` statements.

### Future-Proofing

Given that Python 2.x has reached its official end of life, businesses and communities are transitioning to Python 3 to ensure ongoing support, performance, and security updates. It's vital for developers to keep these differences in mind when migrating projects or coding in Python, especially for modern libraries and frameworks that might only be compatible with Python 3.
<br>

## 2. How does _Python_ manage _memory_?

**Python** employs an **automatic memory management** process, commonly known as **garbage collection**.

This mechanism, combined with **dynamic typing** and the use of **references** rather than direct memory addresses, affords Python both advantages and limitations.

### Advantages

- **Ease of Use**: Developers are relieved of manual memory management tasks, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks and segmentation faults.

- **Flexibility**: Python's dynamic typing allows for more intuitive and rapid development without needing to pre-define variable types.

- **Abstraction**: The absence of direct memory addressing simplifies code implementation, promoting a focus on higher-level tasks.

### Limitations

- **Performance Overhead**: Garbage collection and dynamic typing can introduce latency, potentially impacting real-time or low-latency applications.

- **Resource Consumption**: The garbage collection process consumes CPU and memory resources, sometimes resulting in inefficient use of system resources.

- **Fragmentation**: Continuous allocation and deallocation of memory can lead to memory fragmentation, affecting overall system performance.

### Mechanics of Memory Management

- **Memory Layout**: Python's memory consists of three primary areas: the code segment, global area, and stack and heap for runtime data.

- **Reference Counting**: Python uses a mechanism that associates an object with the number of references to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the object is deleted.

-  **Automated Garbage Collection**: Periodically, Python scans the memory to identify and recover objects that are no longer referenced.

### Code Example: Reference Counting

Here is the Python code:

```python
import sys

# Define and reference an object
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x

# Obtain the reference count
ref_count = sys.getrefcount(x)

print(ref_count)  # Output: 2
```

In this example, the list `[1, 2, 3]` has two references, `x` and `y`. **Note**: `sys.getrefcount` returns the actual count plus one.
<br>

## 3. What is _PEP 8_ and why is it important?

**PEP 8**, short for **Python Enhancement Proposal 8**, is a style guide for Python code. Created by Guido van Rossum, it sets forth recommendations for writing clean, readable Python code.

### Key Principles

- **Readability**: Code structure and naming conventions should make the code clear and understandable, especially for non-authors and during collaborative efforts.

- **Consistency**: The guide aims to minimize surprises by establishing consistent code styles and structures.

- **Maintainability**: Following PEP 8 makes the codebase easier to manage, reducing technical debt.

### Guidelines

PEP 8 addresses different aspects of Python coding, including:

- **Indentation**: Four spaces for each level, using spaces rather than tabs.
- **Line Length**: Suggests a maximum of 79 characters per line for readability.
- **Blank Lines**: Use proper spacing to break the code into logical segments.
- **Imports**: Recommended to group standard library imports, third-party library imports, and local application imports and to sort them alphabetically.
- **Whitespace**: Define when to use spaces around different Python operators and structures.
- **Naming Conventions**: Dissect different naming styles for modules, classes, functions, and variables.
- **Comments**: Recommends judicious use of inline comments and docstrings.

### Code Example

Here is Python code that adheres to some PEP 8 guidelines:

```python
# Good - PEP 8 Compliant
import os
import sys
from collections import Counter
from myapp import MyModule

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """Calculate and return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b

class MyWidget:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Not Recommended - Non-Compliant Code
def calculateProduct(a, b):  # InlineComment
    #someRandomEquation= 1*a**2 / b
    someRandomEquation = 1 * a**2 / b  # Suggested to match previous line
    return someRandomEquation
```
<br>

## 4. Discuss the difference between a _list_, a _tuple_, and a _set_ in _Python_.

Let's discuss the key features, use-cases, and main points of difference among **Python lists, tuples,** and **sets**.

### Key Distinctions

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable, can contain duplicates, and are defined using square brackets `[]`.
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable, can contain duplicates, and are defined using parentheses `()`.
- **Sets**: Unordered, mutable, and do not contain duplicates. Sets are defined using curly braces `{}`, but for an empty set, you should use `set()` to avoid creating an empty dictionary inadvertently.

### Code Example: List, Tuple, and Set

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Defining
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]           # list
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 4)         # tuple
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}             # set

# Output
print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
print(my_tuple)  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 4)
print(my_set)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

In the output, we observe that the list retained all elements, including duplicates. The tuple behaves similarly to a list but is immutable. The set automatically removes duplicates.

### Use-Case: Phone Contacts

Let's consider a scenario where you might use **lists**, **tuples**, and **sets** when dealing with phone contacts.

- **List (Ordered, Mutable, Duplicates Allowed)**: Useful for managing a contact list in an ordered manner, where you might want to add, remove, or update contacts. E.g., `contact_list = ["John", "Doe", "555-1234", "Jane", "Smith", "555-5678"]`.

- **Tuple (Ordered, Immutable, Duplicates Allowed)**: If the contact details are fixed and won't change, you can use a tuple for each contact record. E.g., `contacts = (("John", "Doe", "555-1234"), ("Jane", "Smith", "555-5678"))`.

- **Set (Unordered, Mutable, No Duplicates)**: Helpful when you need to remove duplicates from your contact list. E.g., `unique_numbers = {"555-1234", "555-5678"}`.

### Advantages & Disadvantages

#### Lists

- **Advantages**: Versatile, allows duplicates, supports indexing and slicing.
- **Disadvantages**: Slower operations for large lists.

#### Tuples

- **Advantages**: More memory-efficient, suitable for read-only data.
- **Disadvantages**: Once defined, its contents can't be changed.

#### Sets

- **Advantages**: High-speed membership tests and avoiding duplicates.
- **Disadvantages**: Not suitable for tasks requiring order.
<br>

## 5. Describe how a _dictionary_ works in _Python_. What are _keys_ and _values_?

A **dictionary** in Python is a powerful, built-in data structure for holding **unordered key-value pairs**. Keys are unique, immutable objects such as strings, numbers, or tuples, while values can be any type of object.

### Key Characteristics

- **Unordered**: Unlike lists, which are indexed, dictionaries have no specific sequence of elements.
- **Mutable**: You can modify individual entries, but keys are fixed.
- **Dynamic**: Dictionaries can expand or shrink in size as needed.

### Syntax

Dictionaries are defined within curly braces `{}`, and key-value pairs are separated by a colon. Pairs are themselves separated by commas.

Here is the Python code:

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'is_student': False}
```

### Main Methods

- **`dict.keys()`**: Returns all keys in the dictionary.
- **`dict.values()`**: Returns all values in the dictionary.
- **`dict.items()`**: Returns a list of key-value pairs.

Here is the Python code:

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'is_student': False}

# Accessing individual items
print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: Alice
print(my_dict.get('age'))  # Output: 30

# Changing values
my_dict['age'] = 31

# Inserting new key-value pairs
my_dict['gender'] = 'Female'

# Deleting key-value pairs
del my_dict['is_student']

# Iterating through keys and values
for key in my_dict:
    print(key, ':', my_dict[key])

# More concise iteration using dict.items()
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, ':', value)
```

### Memory Considerations

Dictionaries in Python use a variation of a **hash table**. Their key characteristic is that they are very efficient for lookups ($O(1)$ on average), insertion, and deletion operations. However, **order is not guaranteed**.
<br>

## 6. What is _list comprehension_ and give an example of its use?

**List comprehension** is a concise way to create lists in Python. It is especially popular in data science for its readability and efficiency.

### Syntax

The basic structure of a list comprehension can be given by:

```python
squared = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

This code is equivalent to:

```python
squared = []
for x in range(10):
    squared.append(x**2)
```

### Uses and Advantages

- **Filtering**: You can include an `if` statement to filter elements.
- **Multiple Iterables**: List comprehensions can iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.
- **Set and Dictionary Comprehensions**: While we're discussing list comprehensions, it's noteworthy that Python offers similar mechanisms for sets and dictionaries.

### Example: 


Consider filtering a list of numbers for even numbers and then squaring those. Here is what it looks like using traditional loops:

```python
evens_squared = []
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        evens_squared.append(num**2)
```

Here is the equivalent using a list comprehension.

```python
evens_squared = [num**2 for num in range(10) if num % 2 == 0]
```

### Which is faster

The **ability to use list comprehensions** can make operations **faster** than using traditional loops, as every list comprehension has an equivalent loop (it is a syntactic sugar). If you had to create very long lists in a loop, a list comprehension can offer a performance improvement.
<br>

## 7. Explain the concept of _generators_ in _Python_. How do they differ from _list comprehensions_?

In Python, **generators** and **list comprehensions** are tools for constructing and processing sequences (like lists, tuples, and more). While both produce sequences, they differ in how and when they generate their elements.

### List Comprehensions

**List comprehensions** are concise and powerful constructs for building and transforming lists. They typically build the entire list in memory at once, making them suitable for smaller or eagerly evaluated sequences.

Here is an example of a list comprehension:

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

### Generators

**Generators**, on the other hand, are memory-efficient, lazy sequences. They produce values on-the-fly when iterated, making them suitable for scenarios with potentially large or infinite datasets.

This is how you define a generator expression:

```python
squared = (x**2 for x in range(10))
print(type(squared))
# Output: <class 'generator'>

# When you want to retrieve the elements, you can iterate over it.
for num in squared:
    print(num)
```

### Advantages of Generators

- **Memory Efficiency**: Generators produce values one at a time, potentially saving significant memory.
- **Composability**: They can be composed and combined using methods like `map`, `filter`, and others, making them quite flexible.
- **Infinite Sequences**: Generators can model potentially infinite sequences, which would not be possible to represent with a list.

### Memory Comparison

Using `sys.getsizeof`, let's compare the memory usage of a list versus a generator that both yield square numbers.

```python
import sys

# Memory usage for list
list_of_squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 1001)]
print(sys.getsizeof(list_of_squares))

# Memory usage for generator
gen_of_squares = (x**2 for x in range(1, 1001))
print(sys.getsizeof(gen_of_squares))

"""
Output:
4056  # Memory in bytes for the list
120   # Memory in bytes for the generator
"""
```
<br>

## 8. Discuss the usage of `*args` and `**kwargs` in _function definitions_.

In Python, **args** and **kwargs** are terms used to indicate that a function can accept a variable number of arguments and parameters, respectively.

### `*args`: Variable Positional Arguments

`*args` is used to capture an arbitrary or zero number of **positional arguments**. When calling a function with '*args', the arguments are collected into a tuple within the function. This parameter allows for a flexible number of arguments to be processed.

Here's an example:

```python
def sum_all(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6
```

### `**kwargs`: Variable Keyword Arguments

`**kwargs` is utilized to capture an arbitrary or zero number of **keyword arguments**. When calling a function with `**kwargs`, the arguments are collected into a dictionary within the function. The double star indicates that it's a keyword argument.

This feature is especially handy when developers are unsure about the exact nature or number of keyword arguments that will be transmitted.

Here's an example:

```python
def display_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

display_info(name="Alice", age=25, location="New York")
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 25
# location: New York
```

### Using `*args` and `**kwargs` Together

Developers also have the **flexibility** to use both `*args` and `**kwargs` together in a function definition, allowing them to handle a mix of positional and keyword arguments.

Here's an example demonstrating mixed usage:

```python
def process_data(title, *args, **kwargs):
    print(f"Title: {title}")
    print("Positional arguments:")
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)
    print("Keyword arguments:")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

process_data("Sample Data", 1, 2, complex_param=[4, 5, 6])
# Output:
# Title: Sample Data
# Positional arguments:
# 1
# 2
# Keyword arguments:
# complex_param: [4, 5, 6]
```
<br>

## 9. How does _Python's garbage collection_ work?

**Python** employs automatic **garbage collection** to manage memory, removing the need for manual memory management.

### Mechanism of Python's Garbage Collection

Python employs a **reference counting** strategy along with a **cycle detector** for more complex data structures.

- **Reference Counting**: 

  - Each Python object contains a `gc_refcnt` member, which is a count of the number of references that the object has.
  - When an object is created or a reference to it is copied or deleted, `gc_refcnt` is updated accordingly.

  Reference counting ensures **immediate object reclamation** when an object is no longer referenced (i.e., `gc_refcnt` reaches 0). However, it has limitations in handling **cyclic references** and may lead to **fragmentation**.

- **Cycle Detector**: 

  - Python uses standard **mark-and-sweep** garbage collection, along with a **cycle detector** to handle cyclic references.
  - Common cyclic structures include bidirectional lists, parent-child relationships, and singleton referential patterns.
  - The cycle detector periodically runs in the background to clean up any uncollectable cycles. While this mechanism is efficient, it can lead to unpredictable garbage collection times and might not fully remove all cyclic references immediately.

### Recommendations

- **Avoid Unnecessary Long-Lived References**: To ensure timely object reclamation, limit the scope of references to the minimum required.
- **Leverage Context Managers**: Utilize the `with` statement to encapsulate object references. This ensures the release of resources at the end of the block or upon an exception.
- **Consider Explicit Deletion**: In rare cases where it's necessary, you can manually delete references to objects using the `del` keyword.
- **Use Garbage Collection Module**: The `gc` module provides utilities like enabling or disabling the garbage collector and manual triggers for object reclamation. However, it's important to use such options judiciously, as overuse can impact performance.

### Side Note: CPython Implementation-Specifics

The strategies and mechanisms discussed are specific to CPython, the reference implementation of Python. Other Python implementations like Jython (for Java), IronPython (for .NET), and PyPy may employ different garbage collection methods for memory management.
<br>

## 10. What are _decorators_, and can you provide an example of when you'd use one?

**Decorators** in Python are higher-order functions that modify or enhance the behavior of other functions. They achieve this by taking a function as input, wrapping it inside another function, and then returning the wrapper.

Decorators are often used in web frameworks, such as Flask, for tasks like request authentication and logging. They enable better separation of concerns and modular code design.

### Common Use-Cases for Decorators

- **Debugging**: Decorators can log function calls, parameter values, or execution time.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: They ensure functions are only accessible to authorized users or have passed certain validation checks.
- **Caching**: Decorators can store results of expensive function calls, improving performance.
- **Rate Limiting**: Useful in web applications to restrict the number of requests a function can handle.
- **Validation**: For data integrity checks, ensuring that inputs to functions meet certain criteria.

### Practical Example: Timing Function Execution

Here is the Python code:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    """Decorator that times function execution."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def sleep_and_return(num_seconds):
    """Function that waits for a given number of seconds and then returns that number."""
    time.sleep(num_seconds)
    return num_seconds

print(sleep_and_return(3))  # Output: 3, and the time taken is printed
```

## 15. Explain _Matplotlib_ and _Seaborn_ libraries for _data visualization_.

**Matplotlib** is one of the most widely used libraries for data visualization in Python. It provides a wide range of visualizations, and its interface is highly flexible, allowing for fine-grained control.

**Seaborn**, built on top of Matplotlib, is a higher-level library that focuses on visual appeal and offers a variety of high-level plot styles. It simplifies the process of plotting complex data, making it especially useful for exploratory analysis.

### Matplotlib Features

- **Core Flexibility**: Matplotlib equips you to control every aspect of your visualization.
- **Customizable Plots**: You can customize line styles, colors, markers, and more.
- **Subplots and Axes**: Create multi-plot layouts and specify dimensions.
- **Backends**: Choose from various interactive and non-interactive backends, suiting different use-cases.
- **Output Flexibility**: Matplotlib supports a range of output formats, including web, print, and various image file types.

### Seaborn Features

- **High-Level Interface**: Offers simpler functions for complex visualizations like pair plots and violin plots.
- **Attractive Styles**: Seaborn has built-in themes and color palettes for better aesthetics.
- **Dataset Integration**: Directly accepts Pandas DataFrames.
- **Time-Saving Defaults**: Many Seaborn plots provide well-optimized default settings.
- **Categorical Plots**: Specifically designed to handle categorical data for easier visual analysis.

### Common Visualizations: Matplotlib vs Seaborn

#### Scatter Plots

- **Matplotlib**: Meticulous control over markers, colors, and sizes.
  
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.scatter(x, y, c='red', s=100, marker='x')
  ```

- **Seaborn**: Quick setup with additional features like trend lines.

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.scatterplot(x, y, hue=some_category, style=some_other_category)
  ```

#### Line Plots
  
- **Matplotlib**: Standard line plot visualization.

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot(x, y)
  ```

- **Seaborn**: Offers different styles for lines, emphasizing on the trend.

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.lineplot(x, y, estimator='mean')
  ```

#### Histograms

- **Matplotlib**: Default functionalities for constructing histograms.

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.hist(x, bins=10)
  ```

- **Seaborn**: High-level interface for one-liner histograms.

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.histplot(x, kde=True)
  ```

#### Bar Plots
  
- **Matplotlib**: Provides bar plots and enables fine-tuning.

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.bar(categories, values)
  ```

- **Seaborn**: Specialized categorical features for easy category-specific analysis.

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.catplot(x='category', y='value', kind='bar', data=data)
  ```

#### Heatmaps

- **Matplotlib**: Offers heatmap generation, but with more control and detailed setup.

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.imshow(data, cmap='hot', interpolation='none')
  ```

- **Seaborn**: Simplified, high-level heatmap functionality.

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, fmt="g")
  ```

### Enhanced Visual Aesthetics with Seaborn

While both Matplotlib and Seaborn allow customization, Seaborn stands out for its accessible interface. It comes with several built-in visual styles to enhance the aesthetics of plots.

The code for selecting a style:

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
```

### Benchmark: Matplotlib vs Seaborn

- **Performance**: Matplotlib is faster when dealing with large datasets due to its lower-level operations.
- **Specialized Plots**: Seaborn excels in handling complex, multivariable datasets, providing numerous statistical and categorical plots out of the box.
